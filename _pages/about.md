<h1>About Me </h1> 
<div style='text-align: justify;'>I am Pranav Jeevan P, a doctoral candidate in the <a href="https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in" style="text-decoration: none;">Department of Electrical Engineering</a> at <a href="https://www.iitb.ac.in/" style="text-decoration: none;">Indian Institute of  Technology, Bombay</a>. My research focuses on building resource-efficient neural architectures that can perform multiple computer vision tasks. I have been associated with MeDAL (Medical Imaging, Deep Learning and Artificial Intelligence Lab) and working under the supervision of <a href="https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/~asethi/" style="text-decoration: none;">Prof. Amit Sethi</a>. I did my Masters in Robotics from the Department of Mechanical Engineering at <a href="https://www.iitk.ac.in/" style="text-decoration: none;">Indian Institute of  Technology, Kanpur.</a> I was working in the <a href="http://www.iitk.ac.in/robotics/" style="text-decoration: none;">Center for Mechatronics</a> under the supervision of <a href="https://home.iitk.ac.in/~adutta/" style="text-decoration: none;">Prof. Ashish Dutta</a>, where I developed a lower-extremity exoskeleton for rehabilitation.</div>  
<p>  </p>

<div style='text-align: justify;'>After completing my Masters degree, I worked as Post-graduate Engineering Trainee at <a href="https://www.tatamotors.com/" style="text-decoration: none;">Engineering Research Centre, Tata Motors Limited.</a> I have worked on vehicle evaluation and thermal analysis of brakes in Consumer Vehicle Business Unit. After working in industry for sometime, I moved back to academic research at the <a href="https://physics.iitm.ac.in/" style="text-decoration: none;">Department of Physics</a>, Indian Institute of Technology, Madras.  I did coursework in theoretical physics with special focus on Quantum Computing and Quantum Information. I am doing a 6 month Internship with the AI Camera Team, Camera Solutions Group, Visual Intelligence Division at <a href="https://research.samsung.com/sri-b" style="text-decoration: none;">Samsung R&D Institute India, Bangalore (SRI-B)</a>.</div>

<br>I maintain a list of my publications under the Research tab and my full Resume is attached in the CV Tab.
