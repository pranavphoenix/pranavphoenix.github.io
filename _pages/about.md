<h1>About Me </h1> 
<div style='text-align: justify;'>I am Pranav Jeevan P, a doctoral candidate in the <a href="https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in" style="text-decoration: none;">Department of Electrical Engineering</a> at <a href="https://www.iitb.ac.in/" style="text-decoration: none;">Indian Institute of  Technology, Bombay</a>. My research focuses on building resource-efficient neural architectures that can perform multiple computer vision tasks. I have been associated with MeDAL (Medical Imaging, Deep Learning and Artificial Intelligence Lab) and working under the supervision of <a href="https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/~asethi/" style="text-decoration: none;">Prof. Amit Sethi</a>. I did my Masters in Robotics from the Department of Mechanical Engineering at <a href="https://www.iitk.ac.in/" style="text-decoration: none;">Indian Institute of  Technology, Kanpur.</a> I was working in the <a href="http://www.iitk.ac.in/robotics/" style="text-decoration: none;">Center for Mechatronics</a> under the supervision of <a href="https://home.iitk.ac.in/~adutta/" style="text-decoration: none;">Prof. Ashish Dutta</a>, where I developed a lower-extremity exoskeleton for rehabilitation.</div>

<!-- <div style='text-align: justify;'>During my research, I have been fortunate to work and communicate with various collaborators from the perspective of broad interdisciplinary research. For the last couple of years, I have focussed my research on analysing and quantifying intra-tumour heterogeneity in breast cancer tissues under the mentorship of <a href="https://pathology.uic.edu/directory/peter-h-gann-mdscd/" style="text-decoration: none;">Prof Peter Gann</a>, University of Illinois, Chicago.  Earlier, I have also got the opportunity to work with <a href="https://www.kcl.ac.uk/people/anita-grigoriadis" style="text-decoration: none;">Prof. Anita Grigoriadis</a> of Kings College London, and <a href="https://actrec.irins.org/profile/171459" style="text-decoration: none;">Prof Swapnil Rane</a>, Tata Memorial Centre, Mumbai where we worked on solving robust pathological feature segmentation using novel deep learning pipelines to analyse breast cancer lymph nodes. I also had research assosciations with <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-in/" style="text-decoration: none;"> Nvidia Corporation Mumbai</a> for exploratory and accelerated research in large scale histopathology problems.</div> -->

<br>I maintain a list of my publications under the Research tab and my full Resume is attached the CV Tab.
